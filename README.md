# **Hi there** 👋
Please keep calm 😎 and drink 🥤 while the .gif is loading.

![Let's surf the code](images/code_surfer.gif?raw=true)

I'm a semi-self-taught front end developer who likes surfing (surfing the net is still surfing, isn't it? 🤔 ). I also like my daily Medium.com newsletter (mostly front-end and UI/UX topics) and JavaScript weekly subscription. And CSS-Tricks. And React. And arrow functions. And 🍕 of course! Sometimes I do weird stuff in GIMP or my garage (🔨, 🗜️, 🔧). Aside of being a FED I'm a hacker - Ikea hacker to be precise 😃.
